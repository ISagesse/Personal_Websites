            <p class="leads">
                My name is Israel Michel Sagesse, I am a web developer and a indie game developer, I am specialize more in the back-end of a web development project but
                I am adobe illustrator certified and I have two years of working in personal projects on photoshop. I am verry passionate about technology - not a specific
                framework or language. In this line of work it is more about adaptation and what works best for the project, and  I care deeply about the code I write and
                the effect my work has on the project, I am opened to learning any stack that will minimize the time and my skills up to date.
